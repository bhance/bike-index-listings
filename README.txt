=== Bike Index Stolen Bikes Widget ===

This widget provides a way to easilly list bikes that have been registered with BikeIndex.org. 
Its settings allow you to list bikes near you by geocoding off of your zipcode, and to either show 
a mix of non-stolen/stolen bikes or to show only stolen bikes, depending on your needs.


About BikeIndex.org:
--------------------
BikeIndex.org is an open source bicycle registry that is out to save people the agony of bike theft. 
We work with countless partners like bike shops, bikers, pro-bike orgs and police departments to 
act as a clearinghouse for bike ownership and stolen bike information. 

Through our stolen site - stolen.bikeindex.org - we maintain an easily queryable database of 
stolen bikes - and work with people to chase their bikes down when they pop up on our radar. 
Along the way we do even more interesting things, like run the @isitstolen twitterbot.

Follow us at @bikeindex or @stolenbikereg for more information. 

About this widget:
